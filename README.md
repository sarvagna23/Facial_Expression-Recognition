pressions. Facial expression plays a major role in expressing what a person feels
 and it expresses inner feeling and his or her mental situation or human perspec

 angry, fear, surprised, neutral. Here proposes a real time facial emotion recogni
tion system based on You Look Only Once (YOLO) architecture, Haarcascade
 Algorithm and a squeezenet architecture. It provides significant, accurate object
 detection and extracts high-level features that help to achieve good performance
 to classify the image and detecting objects
